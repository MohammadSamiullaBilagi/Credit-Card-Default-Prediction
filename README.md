# Credit Default Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to build and compare various machine learning models to predict credit card default risk using a publicly available dataset. The goal is to identify customers likely to default on their payments, helping financial institutions manage credit risk effectively.

## Models Compared
- Random Forest
- XGBoost Classifier
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

## Performance Summary
- **Random Forest:** 97.93% accuracy (Best overall model)
- **XGBoost:** 76.64% accuracy
- **Naive Bayes:** 74.89% accuracy
- **Logistic Regression:** 72.91% accuracy
- **SVM:** 72.78% accuracy
- **kNN:** 71.02% accuracy

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Model training, evaluation with classification reports and confusion matrices
- Performance comparison with detailed metrics for each model
- Recommendations based on model performance for credit risk management
